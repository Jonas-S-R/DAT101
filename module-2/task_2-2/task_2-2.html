      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				If the variable is going to change whatsoever, then you should not use const. Const should only be used on steadfast variables.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parenthesis affect the outcome of an expression by forcing the program to calculate the numbers inside the equation first, before moving on.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can limit the number of decimals in a float by either using to.Fixed or math.round.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can compare two floating point numbers by using number.epsilon, which has the smallest distance that can reliably be distinguished (â‰ˆ 2.22e-16).
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators judge variables against each other and give us a result based on their relations. For example, if one function is larger than the other, it will return a true or false, which can be used in an If-statement.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				Math.random() gives us a random number between a range, and it can be used to randomize results, for example.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				The modulus operator calculates what is left after dividing two numbers. Take for example 15/6. We get 6*2+3. In this case, the modulus operator gives us 3.
